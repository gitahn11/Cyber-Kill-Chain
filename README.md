  <li> Reconnaissance: Involves researching potential targets before carrying out any penetration testing. The reconnaissance stage may include identifying potential targets and finding their vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This can be performed both online or offline.  </li>
  <li> Weaponization: The weaponization stage, the attacker creates malware to be used against an identified target. Weaponization can include creating new types of malware or modifying existing tools to use in a cyberattack.  </li>
  <li> Delivery: In the delivery stage tools are used to infiltrate a target’s network and reach users. Delivery may involve sending phishing emails containing malware attachments with subject lines that prompt users to click through.  </li>
  <li> Exploitation: In the exploitation step of the Cyber Kill Chain, attackers take advantage of the vulnerabilities they have discovered in previous stages to further infiltrate a target’s network. </li>
  <li> Installation: After cybercriminals have exploited their target’s vulnerabilities to gain access to a network, they begin the installation stage by attempting to install malware onto the target to take control of the systems and exfiltrate valuable data.</li>
  <li> Command and Control: In the C2 stage, cybercriminals communicate with the malware they’ve installed onto a target’s network to instruct malware to carry out their objectives. </li>
  <li> Actions on Objectives: After cybercriminals have compromised installed a target and taken control of their target’s network, they begin the final stage by carrying out their objective which can include Denial of Service, Data Exfiltration, and Ransomware. </li>
